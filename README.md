# Wordle_Game

## Tutorial
- You'll have 6 chances to guess the 5-letter word, so make every guess count! Try using a word that contains many different letters to narrow down your future guesses.

- After you make a guess, the tile colors will change:
> A green tile indicates that you've guessed the correct letter in the correct place in the word. </br>
> A yellow tile means you've guessed a letter that's in the word, but not in the right spot. </br>
> A gray tile means that letter is not in word. </br>

- Use the clues you got from your previous guess to try to find the correct word. Good Luck ^^
